### Purpose
I want to build a website that is hosted in Azure and the versioning control is through github using my skills obtained from Terraform bootcamp which had alot of materials on Git and how to use it to control versioning. 

The reason i'm building this website is because i'm currently struggling with finding an internship in Sweden Stockholm and i want to seperate myself from your average applicant.


### Solution
With a help from a friend i've obtained a subscription in Azure which allows me to deploy

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
