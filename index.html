								<p><b>I'm currently employed as a consult at CGI where my goal is to learn everything i can in order to advance on my path to become a cloud engineer</b></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://orhanwebstorage.blob.core.windows.net/$web/images/orhan.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm 34 years old, living in the south of Stockholm where I've spent my entire life. In 2021, I moved to Riksten, drawn by my love for nature, and I currently reside there with my wife and daughter.</p>

<p>After completing my military service, I pursued studies in sales within the IT sector, eventually landing a job at Fraktus where I've been employed for 12 years. I initially started in sales, maintaining a minimum yearly portfolio growth of 30%. After a few years, I realized my passion lay closer to the IT field.</p>

<p>As of now, I am keeping my self busy with Infrastructure-As-Code developing internal projects for CGI using DevOps methods. However, my ultimate goal is to become a Cloud Engineer and, hopefully, a Cloud Architect after gaining a few years of experience.</p>
<p>Since im employed with a signed NDA i cannot disclose details but in short i try to embrace DevOps, Copilot, Azure Lighthouse and similar technologies in order to ease the load of my colleagues.</p>
<p>I recently joined "Copilot & Co" which is a newly founded swedish community with goals to improve all members knowledge of Copilot.</p>
<p><i>This website is hosted on Azure, and I manage my code and version control through GitHub. I welcome constructive criticism, so please let me know how I can improve!</i></p>

								<p>My studies involves a comprehensive understanding of IT infrastructure and cloud services, with a specific focus on Azure, given Sweden's predominant use of Microsoft technologies.</p>							
								<h4>Advanced IT Infrastructure</h4>
								<p>In this course, I learned to theoretically and practically install, administer, and configure a Microsoft Windows Server environment. After the course, I acquired the ability to deploy a scalable server environment and manage associated services locally, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment.</p>
								<h4>Microsoft Azure & PowerShell</h4>
								<p>In this course, I learned about the structure, function, and application of Microsoft Azure and the Microsoft scripting language PowerShell. Topics included virtual networks, virtual machines, virtual disks, monitoring, scalability, security, and Cloud Services.</p>
								<h4>Cloud and Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</h4>
								<p>This course covered different service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). I learned about their structure, use cases, cloud delivery via cloud hosting and virtual data centers, cost models, scalability, and infrastructure design changes.</p>
								<h4>Cloud Security</h4>
								<p>This course focused on applying security in a cloud-based environment, covering security for cloud infrastructure, network access, platform-specific user access control, integrated cloud authentication systems, and more. Topics included antivirus protection, encryption, access control, web filtering, access management, firewalls, IPS protection, and an overview of ISO 27001/ISO 27002 and ISO 27018.</p>
								<h4>Server Virtualization: VMWare, Hyper-V, Virtual Box, Linux Operating System</h4>
								<p>In this course, I learned about VMWare and Hyper-V for designing, administering, and developing a cloud environment. Advanced knowledge about infrastructure and platform-specific features for VMWare, Linux OS, and Microsoft Hyper-V was covered. Topics included virtual networks, servers, migration functions, virtual resource management, virtual storage, scalability, security, troubleshooting, Cisco routing products, switches, and more. The course also covered Cisco switch and router configuration with a CLI interface.</p>
