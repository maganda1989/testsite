								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<p><b>I'm currently looking for a workplace who can offer me a LIA between 2023-12-18 and 2024-04-05. The dates are flexible</b></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://orhanwebstorage.blob.core.windows.net/$web/images/orhan.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm 34 years old living in south of Stockholm where i've lived my whole life. I moved out to Riksten as i enjoy nature in 2021 where i'm currently living with my wife and daughter. </p>
								<p>After my military service i studied to work with sales within the IT sector which helped me secure my job at Fraktus where i've worked for 12 years. I started off with sales where i maintained a minimum yearly portfolio growth of 30% and after a couple years i realised i wanted to work closer to IT.</p>
								<p>My passion for IT starts from when i was young enjoying computer gaming and i've always maintained an interest in new-technologies and i was probably the first buyer of the MP3-player among my friends</p>
								<p>Since some people today doesn't even know what an MP3 player is i'm humble to the fact that the tech-sector is moving extremely fast. I spend my time mostly with my family and friends however when i do have the possibility i try staying in the loop specially for the cloud computing sector but also other areas like AI, Machine learning and areas of interest like cryptocurrencies.</p>
								<p>As of now i'm REALLY interested in FinOps and machine learning however my goal is to become a Cloud Engineer and someday hopefully an cloud-architect after a couple of years gaining experience. </p>
								<p>This website is hosted in Azure and i'm pushing my code and version controling it through GitHub. I really appreciate constructive critisizm so let me know what i can do better! </p>

									<p>I've gained a wide range of experience, and my aim is to bring together these diverse experiences as I work towards becoming a solutions architect.</p>

									<p>In the area of cloud computing, I've spent over a year working hands-on with both AWS and Azure, becoming proficient in the fundamental operations of these platforms.</p>

									<p>In the field of logistics, my experience spans over 10 years, during which I've implemented and successfully sold solutions covering global logistics. I proudly consider myself highly skilled and my customers would define me as a black-belt within this area</p>

									<p>In sales, my track record speaks for itself, with a turnover exceeding +10 million SEK. In my prime I stood out as one of the top-performing salesmen, showcasing a strong ability to achieve results.</p>

									<p>In project management, I'm well-versed in agile methodologies, using tools like Kanban and resource planning to coordinate seamless IT development.

								<p>My ongoing studies involves a comprehensive understanding of IT infrastructure and cloud services, with a specific focus on Azure, given Sweden's predominant use of Microsoft technologies.</p>							
								<h4>Advanced IT Infrastructure</h4>
								<p>In this course, I learned to theoretically and practically install, administer, and configure a Microsoft Windows Server environment. After the course, I acquired the ability to deploy a scalable server environment and manage associated services locally, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment.</p>
								<h4>Microsoft Azure & PowerShell</h4>
								<p>In this course, I learned about the structure, function, and application of Microsoft Azure and the Microsoft scripting language PowerShell. Topics included virtual networks, virtual machines, virtual disks, monitoring, scalability, security, and Cloud Services.</p>
								<h4>Cloud and Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</h4>
								<p>This course covered different service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). I learned about their structure, use cases, cloud delivery via cloud hosting and virtual data centers, cost models, scalability, and infrastructure design changes.</p>
								<h4>Cloud Security</h4>
								<p>This course focused on applying security in a cloud-based environment, covering security for cloud infrastructure, network access, platform-specific user access control, integrated cloud authentication systems, and more. Topics included antivirus protection, encryption, access control, web filtering, access management, firewalls, IPS protection, and an overview of ISO 27001/ISO 27002 and ISO 27018.</p>
								<h4>Server Virtualization: VMWare, Hyper-V, Virtual Box, Linux Operating System</h4>
								<p>In this course, I learned about VMWare and Hyper-V for designing, administering, and developing a cloud environment. Advanced knowledge about infrastructure and platform-specific features for VMWare, Linux OS, and Microsoft Hyper-V was covered. Topics included virtual networks, servers, migration functions, virtual resource management, virtual storage, scalability, security, troubleshooting, Cisco routing products, switches, and more. The course also covered Cisco switch and router configuration with a CLI interface.</p>
